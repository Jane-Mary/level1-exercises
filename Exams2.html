<h2>ANSWER</h2>
<p>
    To begin with, i chose a dark theme because i believe it is suitable for everyone. This is so as to prevent people with eye defects from stressing due to the bright light and making it easier to approach.
</p>
<p>For the text i chose a light blue colour because it is eye friendly and it will not be difficult for the user to navigate to where they are going to because the text will be lighter than the background.</p>
<p>I inserted a little text below so that users who dont know the use of the app will get a little knowledge from there.Also,the "LEARN MORE" button at the center page is also to emphasize more on the app and its uses.</p>
<p>There is also a navigation bar at the top page that helps to direct the user to their homepage,a platform for short videos ,a platform to create videos of their choice,a platform that shows them their downloaded and  previously watched videos and also a platform for all their subscriptions</p>
